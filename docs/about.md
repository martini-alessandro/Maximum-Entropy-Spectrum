Hi!
This project is the master thesis by Alessandro Martini at University of Pisa (Italy), under the supervision of Walter Del Pozzo.

With time, the software improved until it became a python package, available for the general public. If you want to read more about the methods, a paper is being published ([2106.09499](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09499) arxiv preprint), where we detail the method and we apply it to the problem of estimating the PSD of the output of a gravitational waves interferometer.

For more information, you can contact the author [alessandro.martini-1@unitn.it](mailto:alessandro.martini-1@unitn.it) or the package manteiner [s.schmidt@uu.nl](mailto:s.schmidt@uu.nl).
